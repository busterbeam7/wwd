# The WWD Database
This repo holds a list of waifus and scripts related to the WWD for whatever
use you might want. Feel free to request corrections and additions. 

[Check the website][github-page] with web-apps related to WWD, currently It holds a [random waifu picker][random-picker]

If you dont know Git you can Download everything [Here][download], Check the list [Here][waifu_list],
or Get the raw **csv** [Here][waifu_raw].

## The Files
- *waifus.csv* contains the current list of waifus and probably what you want.
  [click here to look at it][waifu_list], [click here to edit it][waifu_edit]
  note that the change won't be immediate but I'll try to approve changes
  regularly.
- *random_waifu_(SYSTEM).XXX* is a script that picks a random waifu. If you dont
  know what is this, on windows just click *random_waifu_(windows).bat*.

## To do / Ideas
- A script to get upcoming birthdays.
- A drawfag database.

## Why Git?
*Git* is made for distributed colaboration. I am aware that most people don't
know how to use it but I hope you can at least use the github site.
I understand if you don't know how so [Here's a raw waifu list][waifu_raw] and I hope
it's useful.

In the site you can edit any file by clicking the pen icon and commiting it as
a *pull request*. I need to approve the change so it won't appear immediatly. 
You can also suggest changes or corrections in the [Issues][issues] section, 
please read existing ones to avoid posting duplicates. 

If you know how to use *git* or want to learn I'll be happy if you can colaborate.

## Why CSV?
*CSV* is an eazy to read and edit interchangeable format. You can even open it in Excel if you want.
The rows are separated by new lines and the columns are sepparated with commas. 

I started with the fields: *Name*, *Series* and *Birthday* but feel free to suggest better
or more relevant fields.

- *Name* order hasn't been decided yet.
- *Dates* should be in ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
